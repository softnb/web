    <strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong> <p>
                  By downloading or using the app, these terms will 
					automatically apply to you . you should make sure therefore 
					that you read them carefully before using the app. You&#39;re 
					not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, 
					or our trademarks in any way. You&#39;re not allowed to attempt 
					to extract the source code of the app, and you also 
					shouldn&#39;t try to translate the app into other languages or 
					make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the 
					trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other 
					intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to 
					Nurettin BARDAKCI.
                </p> <p>
                  The developer is committed to ensuring that the app is as 
					useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we 
					reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge 
					for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will 
					never charge you for the app or its services without making 
					it very clear to you exactly what you&#39;re paying for.
                </p> <p>
                  The NB Drop The Number Seven app stores and processes personal 
					data that you have provided to us, to provide my Service. 
					It&#39;s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to 
					the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not 
					jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of 
					removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by 
					the official operating system of your device. It could make 
					your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, 
					compromise your phone&#39;s security features and it could mean 
					that the NB Drop The Number Seven app won&#39;t work properly or 
					at all.
                </p> <div><p>
                    The app does use third-party services that declare their 
					Terms and Conditions.

                  You should be aware that there are certain things that the 
					developer will not take responsibility for. Certain 
					functions of the app will require the app to have an active 
					internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided 
					by your mobile network provider, but the developer cannot 
					take responsibility for the app not working at full 
					functionality if you don&#39;t have access to Wi-Fi, and you 
					don&#39;t have any of your data allowance left.
                </p> <p></p> <p>
                  If you&#39;re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you 
					should remember that the terms of the agreement with your 
					mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you 
					may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data 
					for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, 
					or other third-party charges. In using the app, you&#39;re 
					accepting responsibility for any such charges, including 
					roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home 
					territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data 
					roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on 
					which you&#39;re using the app, please be aware that we assume 
					that you have received permission from the bill payer for 
					using the app.
                </p> <p>
                  Along the same lines, the developer cannot always take 
					responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to 
					make sure that your device stays charged . if it runs out of 
					battery and you can&#39;t turn it on to avail the Service, the 
					developer cannot accept responsibility.
                </p> <p>
                  With respect to the developer responsibility for your use of 
					the app, when you&#39;re using the app, it&#39;s important to bear 
					in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is 
					updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third 
					parties to provide information to us so that we can make it 
					available to you. the developer accepts no liability for any 
					loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of 
					relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
                </p> <p>
                  At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is 
					currently available on Android . the requirements for the 
					system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend 
					the availability of the app to) may change, and you&#39;ll need 
					to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. 
					The developer does not promise that it will always update 
					the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the 
					Android version that you have installed on your device. 
					However, you promise to always accept updates to the 
					application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop 
					providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time 
					without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell 
					you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and 
					licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you 
					must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your 
					device.
                </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p>
                  I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, 
					you are advised to review this page periodically for any 
					changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new 
					Terms and Conditions on this page.
                </p> <p>
                  These terms and conditions are effective as of 2022-11-18
